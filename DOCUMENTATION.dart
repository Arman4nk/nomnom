/// ## Project Structure
///
/// The project follows a modular structure based on Clean Architecture:
///
/// ```dart
/// lib
/// ├── data       // Implementation of data sources, repositories, and models.
/// ├── domain     // Core business logic, entities, repositories, and use cases.
/// └── presentation // UI layer, including BLoCs, events, states, and UI components.
/// ```
///
/// ## Dependencies
///
/// NomNom relies on the following key dependencies:
///
/// - [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): State management library.
/// - [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable): Simplifies equality comparisons for Dart objects.
/// - [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it): Dependency injection package.
///
/// Make sure to check the latest versions of these dependencies on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).
///
/// ## Running the App
///
/// To run the NomNom app locally, follow these steps:
///
/// 1. Clone the repository:
///
///    ```bash
///    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nomnom.git
///    ```
///
/// 2. Navigate to the project directory:
///

///
/// ## Key Components
///
/// ### Data Layer
///
/// - **Models**: Data classes representing the structure of various entities.
/// - **Data Sources**:
///   - `remote_food_data_source.dart`: Interface for fetching food data from a remote server.
///   - `local_food_data_source.dart`: Interface for caching or storing food data locally.
/// - **Repositories Implementation**:
///   - `food_repository_impl.dart`: Implements the `FoodRepository` interface, fetching data from remote and/or local sources.
///
/// ### Domain Layer
///
/// - **Entities**: Core business objects, e.g., `food_entity.dart`.
/// - **Repositories**: Interface defining methods to interact with food data.
/// - **Use Cases**:
///   - `get_all_food_usecase.dart`: Use case to get a list of all available food items.
///   - `get_food_details_usecase.dart`: Use case to get details for a specific food item.
///
/// ### Presentation Layer
///
/// - **BLoCs**:
///   - `food_bloc.dart`: Handles business logic and state management related to food items.
/// - **Events**:
///   - `food_event.dart`: Defines events that can be dispatched to the `FoodBloc`.
